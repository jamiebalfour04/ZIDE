# ZIDE - ZPE Integrated Development Environment
An editor was built into the language runtime JAR as part of the continuing growth of ZPE and ZPE/YASS. This change has made development more accessible and easier over time. However, its main issue has always been that it is tied to a release of ZPE. 

ZIDE seeks to change this by working completely separately from ZPE yet connecting to it through various streamlined methods.
